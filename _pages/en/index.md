hJOP is a software package allowing dispatchers to control a model railway via
interface based on ZTP-JOP. ZTP-JOP is a GUI specification for real
computer-controlled railway systems heavily used in the Czech Republic.

hJOP is nowadays deployed on multiple model railways in [Model Railroader Club
Brno I](http://kmz-brno.cz/) (pages available in czech only). hJOP is used
to control layouts on exhibitions as well as on internal club events. hJOP
is also deployed on model railways in [Laboratory of Railroad
Control](http://lrkv.pef.mendelu.cz/), MENDEL university Brno.

hJOP allows to create any model railroad layout, it is as simple as drawing
images in MS Paint. However one needs to have some basic knowledge of real
Railroad safety systems.

This project is developed as an opensource under Apache License v2.0. Anyone
can download [source codes](https://github.com/kmzbrnoI/) or compiled binaries.

The software package consists of multiple applications. It mainly targets on
users in the Czech Republic. Graphic interface and many materials are available
in czech only. The aim of this english page is to provide basic information
about hJOP existence, not to motivate english-speaking users to use hJOP. We
do not currently plan to translate hJOP to any other languages than czech.

More information is available in [czech version of this page](/cz).
