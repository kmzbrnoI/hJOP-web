hJOP is nowadays deployed on multiple model railways in [Model Railroader Club
Brno I](http://kmz-brno.cz/) (pages available in czech only). hJOP is used
to control layouts on exhibitions as well as on internal club events. hJOP
is also deployed on model railways in [Laboratory of Railroad
Control](http://lrkv.pef.mendelu.cz/), MENDEL university Brno.

hJOP allows everyone to create model railroad layout, it is as simple as
drawing images in MS Paint. However, to create a proper layout, one needs to
have some basic knowledge of real Railroad safety systems.

hJOP is developed as an opensource project under Apache License v2.0. Anyone
can download [source codes](https://github.com/kmzbrnoI/) or compiled binaries.

This software packages consists of multiple applications. It mainly targets on
users in The Czech Republic. Graphic interface and many materials are available
in czech only. The aim of this english pages is to provide basic information
about hJOP existence, not to motivate english-speaking users to use hJOP. We
do not currently plan to translate hJOP to any other language than czech.

A lot of more information is available in [czech version of this page](/cz).
